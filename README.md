#2048 Python Game
###Owen Klaiss

This README contains instructions on how to build and play my implementation of 2048 in Python. 

##Instructions
Use the w,a,s,d keys to move up, left, down or right. Press Ctrl-C to quit. Press enter after entering an input (move) to confirm your selection. After entering an input, all tiles will slide in the direction of your input and like tiles will add together. The goal is to get a tile to have the value 2048. If you can no longer move, the game is over.
